# Todo List (Vanilla JavaScript)

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **Todo List app** built using **pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
It allows users to:

- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

This project is perfect for beginners who want to **practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing app state** before moving on to bigger projects like Habit Trackers or API apps.

   - Layout basics for a clean interface

3. **JavaScript Basics**
   - Variables and arrays (`let tasks = []`)
   - Functions and calling them on events
   - Event listeners (`element.addEventListener("click", callback)`)
